# Ubuntu 24.04 rather than a smaller base because cmake/black.cmake downloads a
# prebuilt black-sat .deb only on noble, and builds it from source against z3
# anywhere else. That fallback works; it costs several minutes and a z3
# toolchain in the builder for a binary that is already published.
ARG BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:24.04

# Fixed by the `release` preset in CMakePresets.json, which puts its build tree
# at ${sourceDir}/build-release. Every stage below has to use the same path: the
# fetch modules install into ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/third_party and skip their own
# work when they find a done-stamp there, and a stamp under a different prefix
# is a stamp the real build never looks for.
ARG BUILD_DIR=/src/build-release

# Caps every compile in the image build. BuildKit runs the dependency stages at
# once and ignores the daemon-side --cpu flags, so this is the knob that stops a
# build taking the whole machine; leave it unset for one job per core.
#
# It reaches the compiler by sitting in the RUN command, which puts it in the
# cache key of every stage that reads it — Spot's included. Changing the value
# therefore rebuilds Spot, so pick one and keep it rather than tuning it per
# build.

# lsb-release is load-bearing: cmake/black.cmake decides between the prebuilt
# .deb and the source build on `lsb_release -cs`, and the command is absent from
# the base image. Without it the codename reads empty, the noble test fails, and
# the build silently takes the long way round.
#
# libz3-dev is what makes that long way round work, and arm64 has no other
# route: upstream publishes one Linux black binary and it is x86_64, so every
# other architecture compiles black against a solver library it finds here.

# three by orders of magnitude — they fetch prebuilt binaries where it compiles
# a library — so keeping them apart is what stops a Ganak version bump, or an
# edit to any other module under cmake/, costing that rebuild. They depend on
# nothing but the toolchain, so BuildKit runs them concurrently.
