dashboard.hpp
=============

Streams a run's progress to ``<output-dir>/progress.jsonl`` as it happens, and
copies the dashboard page beside it, so serving the output directory is all a
viewer needs::

   counter --dashboard --input <spec> --output-dir <dir>
   python3 -m http.server -d <dir> 8000

Opt-in: ``counter --dashboard`` or ``[runtime] dashboard = true``. A writer
constructed disabled touches nothing and every method on it is a no-op, so
neither driver branches on whether progress was asked for.

``DashboardWriter`` appends one JSON object per line and flushes each as it is
written — the page polls the file mid-run, so a buffered line is a line the
viewer cannot see. Four record types are emitted, each tagged with ``type``:
``run_start`` (input, generation and population counts, seed, objective names),
``stage`` (one per pipeline stage per generation, with its name, ``n_in``,
``n_out`` and elapsed time), ``generation`` (timing, best and mean fitness,
per-objective means, realizable count) and ``run_end``.

No stage name is written down anywhere. ``run_start`` carries the roster of
every stage a generation *can* run, built by ``generation_stage_names`` from the
same pipeline the run uses, so it cannot drift from it; the ``stage`` records
then say which of them actually ran. A new filter or pipeline stage therefore
appears without either side being taught about it.

The roster exists so the page can lay the stage chart out at a fixed height with
each stage on a fixed row. Filters run on intervals, so the active set shrinks
and grows between generations; a chart sized to whichever stages happened to run
would change height underneath the reader. Stages absent from a generation keep
their row, struck through and greyed.

Optional fields are omitted rather than defaulted. ``n_realizable`` is absent
when the driver does not measure it per generation — the TLSF path checks
realizability only at the end of a run — so the page can distinguish "not
measured" from "none found". ``muc_iter`` appears only under MUC-guided repair,
which restarts its generation count per core.

A writer that cannot open its file reports once and then does nothing: losing
the progress log must never take a repair run with it.
