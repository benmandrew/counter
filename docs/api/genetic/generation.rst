genetic/generation.hpp
=======================

The main driver of one generation of the genetic repair loop. Key types:

``FilterFunction``
  A named, stateful wrapper around a population-to-population callable that
  also tracks the input and output sizes of the most recent invocation for
  diagnostic output. Constructed implicitly from any compatible callable.

``ScoredSpecification``
  A ``Specification`` paired with its aggregated fitness score.

``evolve_generation`` runs truncation selection (sort by fitness, take top
*N* as parents) with elitism: the best *E* parents carry over verbatim,
bypassing crossover, mutation, and the filters, so the fittest candidates are
never lost to a stochastic operator. The remaining parents produce offspring
via crossover and mutation; the per-generation filter pipeline runs on those
offspring, the elites are added back, the result is padded to *N* if filters
removed too many, then scored. Progress callbacks are forwarded to the
scoring step.

Factory functions ``get_filter_functions`` and ``get_final_filter_functions``
assemble the standard filter sequences for in-generation and post-evolution use.
