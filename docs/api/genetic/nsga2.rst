=================

The NSGA-II selection primitives for multi-objective evolution, an alternative
to the weighted-average scalar used by the default scheme. They rank a
population by Pareto dominance and diversity rather than a single blended score,
so the search can spread across the Pareto front of realizable repairs.

``dominates``
  Pareto dominance under the project convention that higher is better: one
  objective vector dominates another when it is at least as good in every
  objective and strictly better in at least one.

``non_domination_ranks``
  Deb's fast non-dominated sort. Returns the 0-based front index of each
  individual (0 = the Pareto front, higher = increasingly dominated).

``crowding_distances``
  The crowding distance of each individual within its own front (Deb et al.
  2002): the range-normalised gap between an individual's neighbours summed
  over the objectives, with the per-front extremes of every objective given an
  infinite distance so the boundaries of the front are always preferred.

``nsga2_sort``
  Fills each ``Scored<Spec>`` element's ``rank`` and ``crowding_distance`` from
  its objective vector, then stable-sorts the population by the crowded
  comparison operator (front rank ascending, then crowding distance
  descending).
