runner/formaliser.hpp
======================

Wrapper around the external FRET requirement-formaliser CLI
(``fretCLI.main.js formalize --logic ft-inf --batch``), a persistent Node.js
process started once and reused rather than spawned per call like the other
``runner/`` tools. ``PersistentProcess`` owns the child's stdin/stdout pipes;
``RequirementFormaliser`` memoises results by requirement text and serialises
subprocess round trips through ``m_proc_mutex``, since the child's single
ordered stdin/stdout channel has no way to match a response back to its
request if two callers' writes interleave.

``global_formaliser()`` returns the process-lifetime instance shared by all
callers, so the memoisation cache and the single child process are shared
across the entire run.
