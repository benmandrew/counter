tlsf/fitness.hpp
================

TLSF analogues of the FRETISH fitness components — syntactic similarity,
semantic (bounded-model-counting) similarity, a Halstead size penalty, and a
tiered realizability status — plus ``tlsf_get_fitness_function``, which
assembles them into a weighted aggregate over ``tlsf::Specification`` gated on
the same ``cfg.fitness_weight_*`` fields the FRETISH factory uses.
