tlsf/pipeline.hpp
=================

``tlsf::run_repair`` is the end-to-end TLSF genetic-repair driver. It parses a
basic-TLSF input, evolves a population under the TLSF fitness, filters, and
genetic operators (:doc:`fitness`, :doc:`filter`, :doc:`operators`), collects
the realizable, deduplicated survivors, and writes each to
``<output_dir>/repair_N.tlsf`` with a ``repair_N.fitness.json`` sidecar. It is
the TLSF analogue of the FRETISH pipeline in ``src/main.cpp``.
