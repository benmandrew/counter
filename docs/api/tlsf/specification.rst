tlsf/specification.hpp
======================

The ``tlsf::Specification`` type: a basic-format TLSF (Temporal Logic Synthesis
Format) specification decomposed into its six named sections (``INITIALLY``,
``PRESET``, ``REQUIRE``, ``ASSUME``, ``ASSERT``, ``GUARANTEE``) plus the
input/output signal universes and a ``Semantics`` tag (Mealy/Moore ×
standard/strict).

``to_ltl`` lowers a specification to a single LTL formula in SPOT syntax using
the standard-implication semantics: the assumption side conjoins
``conj(INITIALLY)``, ``G(conj(REQUIRE))``, and ``conj(ASSUME)``; the guarantee
side conjoins ``conj(PRESET)``, ``G(conj(ASSERT))``, and ``conj(GUARANTEE)``;
the result is ``assumptions -> guarantees`` (or just the guarantee side when no
assumption term is present). Strict semantics are recorded but not yet
distinguished from standard.
