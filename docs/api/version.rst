version.hpp
===========

Records which git commit a binary was built from, so a result can be traced
back to the code that produced it. Every binary accepts ``--version`` and
answers with three ``key=value`` lines::

   $ counter --version
   commit=b929201d0c0e5a5f9b0a5a7d5f2f3b1c4d6e8a90
   commit_short=b929201
   dirty=0

The commit is resolved at *build* time, not configure time. A
``git rev-parse`` run from ``CMakeLists.txt`` records whatever HEAD was when
cmake last ran, so ``cmake --build`` after a new commit keeps reporting the old
hash — which is precisely the case the flag exists to catch. Instead
``cmake/version.cmake`` declares a target that runs
``cmake/write_version_header.cmake`` in script mode on every build; that script
renders ``cmake/version.hpp.in`` through ``configure_file``, which rewrites the
header only when the content changed. A build that changed no commit therefore
costs one ``git rev-parse`` and invalidates nothing.

Only ``src/version.cpp`` includes the generated header, and only
``counter_core`` has its directory on the include path. A new commit recompiles
that one translation unit and relinks; the rest of the tree is untouched.

``dirty`` reports modified *tracked* files (``git status --porcelain
--untracked-files=no``). Untracked files are excluded on purpose: they are not
compiled into anything, so they cannot explain a binary that disagrees with its
commit. A source tree that is not a git work tree at all — an exported tarball,
say — falls back to ``unknown`` rather than failing the build.

All five binaries answer the flag — ``counter``, ``realize``, ``compare``,
``ltl`` and ``mucs`` — since a campaign's numbers come out of ``counter`` and
``compare`` together, and knowing which built one of them is worth little
without the other.
