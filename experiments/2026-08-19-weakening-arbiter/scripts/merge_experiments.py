"""Pull experiment results from remote machines and merge them into this repo.

Idempotent: run it as many times as you like. Per-run result directories are
named with their seed (``sweep_A_gen10_fsm_seed17``) so they never collide
between machines; rsync only transfers what changed. The aggregate CSV is
merged by its natural key (see KEY_FIELDS), keeping exactly one row per key, so
re-running never duplicates rows.

``--profile`` selects which CSV to merge, and must match the profile the runs
were executed under: each profile writes its own CSV, so merging a profile's
results needs the same ``--profile`` the runs used.

Configure the remote machines in REMOTES below, then:

    python scripts/merge_experiments.py                  # pull from all REMOTES (full)
    python scripts/merge_experiments.py av2 av3          # only named remotes
    python scripts/merge_experiments.py --dry-run        # show rsync plan, no writes
    python scripts/merge_experiments.py /path/to/copy    # merge an already-rsynced dir

A source may be a remote (``host:/path/to/counter``) or a local path to another
counter checkout. Bare hostnames use REMOTE_ROOT as the repo path.

# enters a KEY_FIELDS key is what lets an archived row and a new one join as one
# row rather than merging into two. Duplicated from run_experiments.py rather
# than imported, like every other LEGACY_* constant here: both scripts are
