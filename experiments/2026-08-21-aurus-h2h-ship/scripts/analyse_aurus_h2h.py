"""Pre-registered analysis for the 2026-08-14 counter-against-AuRUS campaign.

Runs the decision rule of `experiments/2026-08-14-aurus-h2h/PLAN.md` §5 as
amended by §10.1 and §10.2:

  primary    per-family repair-quality rate, counter's implies_ideal over its
             20 seeds against AuRUS's implies_genuine over its 30 repeats,
             two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank over families at alpha 0.05
  clustered  the same test over the 10 independent problem types of §7.10,
             each contributing the mean of its families' rates -- the result
             the conclusion rests on where the two disagree
  secondary  §6's measures, none of which can move the outcome

§10.1 is what makes the two rates comparable: AuRUS's is over the repairs that
are both realizable under `realize` and well-separated under
`check_well_separated`, because counter's output gate rejects an ill-separated
survivor unconditionally and its rate is over well-separated repairs by
construction. The unfiltered rate rides along as implies_genuine_all and is
reported beside it, never in place of it.

Written after the campaign to read the merged CSVs, so this is not a vendored
driver copy -- it ran nothing.
