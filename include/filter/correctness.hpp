/// @c admissible to every survivor regardless of that flag, and the input
/// screen applies it once to the specification the run starts from. A property
/// enforced in only the first of those leaks through anything the search did
/// not breed -- an elite, or the seed population -- which is what made a
/// per-generation-only filter insufficient (issues #73, #77).
