/// Returns whether the system can vacuously satisfy @p specification by
/// falsifying its own assumptions.
///
/// Realizability is decided on `(assumptions) -> (guarantees)`, so a candidate
/// is satisfied for free on any trace where the assumptions fail. A candidate
/// is *well-separated* when the system cannot force that outcome: no system
/// strategy makes the assumptions fail against every environment. Equivalently,
/// the specification obtained by replacing the guarantees with `false` --
/// `(assumptions) -> false`, i.e. `!(assumptions)` -- must be *unrealizable*.
/// If it is realizable, the system has a strategy that drives the output atoms
/// so the assumptions break, satisfying the original specification without
/// repairing anything.
///
/// This is complementary to the vacuity filter's satisfiability check:
/// assumptions can be perfectly satisfiable yet still forcibly falsifiable by
/// the system, because satisfiability treats every atom symmetrically whereas
/// realizability respects the input/output partition. Joint unsatisfiability of
/// the assumptions is the vacuity filter's concern, not this one; it runs
/// first.
///
/// The ltlsynt query runs only when an assumption references an output atom.
/// Input-only assumptions are well-separated by construction and answered
/// without a solver call, since the system controls nothing it could use to
/// break them.
///
/// A specification with no assumptions has nothing to falsify and is reported
/// well-separated without a solver call. An ltlsynt query that times out is
/// undecided, and reads here as *not* well-separated, so the candidate is
/// dropped: this filter keeps a candidate exactly when the query comes back
/// unrealizable, which makes the fallback every other caller uses the unsafe
/// one here.
///
/// A query that *raises* is resolved identically: an exception is a query that
/// produced no verdict, the same as one killed at its budget, so it is caught,
/// counted in `WellSeparationStats::n_errors`, and dropped by the same
/// `value_or` fallback. Letting it propagate instead would end the run, because
/// filters run outside the scoring pool's `Config::max_scoring_failure_rate`
/// tolerance -- and the throw is reachable in practice, since SPOT 2.15.1's
/// `ltlsynt` aborts with "Too many acceptance sets used" on specifications the
/// search reaches on its own.
