/// Scores a candidate on the shared status scale, given its component formulae
/// and a way to decide realizability. Both front ends route through this, so
/// the scale lives in one place; only the decomposition into components and
/// the realizability query differ between them.
///
/// The scale is deliberately coarse. Earlier revisions graded the region below
/// realizability more finely -- separate tiers for an unsatisfiable guarantee
/// side and an unsatisfiable assumption side, mirroring the design this search
/// is derived from. Instrumenting both front ends over 887k scored candidates
/// found those tiers hold under 0.32% of the population between them.
///
/// The two failed for different reasons. The guarantee-side tier was measured:
/// nothing filters a jointly unsatisfiable guarantee side, and it fired on 46
/// candidates out of 15,115 on the TLSF path, all on one specification. The
/// assumption-side tier never fired at all, and could not have: its predicate
/// is exactly the vacuity filter's, and candidate filters run on offspring
/// *before* those offspring are scored, so such a candidate is discarded
/// before it reaches this function. The tier was unreachable in any run
/// leaving run_vacuity_filter on, which is the default -- it re-asked a
/// question a filter had already acted on.
///
/// Grading *within* unrealizability needs a measure of how far a candidate is
/// from realizable, which a satisfiability query cannot express.
///
/// The top tier means realizable *for a real reason*: both callers fold
/// well-separation into @p is_realizable, so a candidate the system can satisfy
/// only by forcing its own assumptions to fail scores k_status_unrealizable
/// rather than k_status_realizable. That is a correction to what the top tier
/// meant, not a fourth tier. A tier between the two would rank cheating above
/// failing, and ill-separation is cheap for mutation to reach and expensive to
/// leave, so the intermediate score would be a broad plateau that the search
/// settles on -- the shape the aggregate fitness already shows for gutted,
/// vacuous repairs. Scoring it level with unrealizable keeps the candidate in
/// the population as breeding material, which is the whole value of not simply
/// dropping it, and pays it nothing for the cheat.
///
/// Reachable only because well-separation no longer runs as a pre-scoring
/// filter by default. A tier whose predicate a filter has already acted on is
/// unreachable by construction, which is what happened to the assumption-side
/// tier above.

/// The walk admits parts in @p admission_order, taking each one whose addition

/// walk shipped with; Config::mrs_admission_order selects what the front ends
/// pass instead.
///
/// Any order works here so long as it is the *same* order for every candidate
/// in a run, which is what keeps the score a deterministic function of the
/// candidate -- the seed reproducibility the `determinism` suite pins requires
/// that, and nothing about index order in particular. It is also what keeps
/// RealizabilityChecker's cache: two candidates differing only at part m ask
/// identical queries at every step before m's position, whatever permutation
/// puts it there. Measured over populations of mutants, every fixed order costs
/// 1.02x to 1.07x index order's ltlsynt execs, against 1.48x for a fresh order
/// per candidate.
///
/// The accumulated indices are kept sorted, so a set of parts reaches the

/// ends build their subset in the order they are handed, so without this the
/// cache would key on the admission sequence rather than on the set.
///
/// Well-separation belongs *inside* @p subset_realizable rather than as a
/// post-hoc cap on a full-marks score. Folding it in costs an ill-separated
/// candidate the part that made it so, and leaves 1.0 meaning what it means on
/// the tiered scale -- realizable for a real reason. Capping instead would need
/// a value just below 1.0, which would rank a candidate that games its own

/// otherwise pay @p n_parts realizability queries to learn nothing.
