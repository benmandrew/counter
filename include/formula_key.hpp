/// @file formula_key.hpp
/// @brief Canonical cache keys for LTL formula strings.
///
/// Every memoisation cache between the search and the external tools is keyed
/// on a rendered formula string, and `Formula` is a binary tree with no
/// canonical shape, so one formula reaches a cache under many spellings and
/// each spelling buys its own subprocess. Measured over 14 specifications,
/// replacing the raw string with the key these functions produce removes
/// 22.1% of the `simplify_ltl` execs a run makes, 13.9% of `ltlsynt`'s and
/// 11.3% of `count_traces`'s; where the atom renaming also applies, those
/// become 31.6%, 16.2% and 15.7%.
///
/// The keys are computed from the string rather than from the AST because the
/// caches receive strings, and because the same formula reaches several of
/// them by different routes. Each entry point memoises on its raw input, so a
/// spelling already seen costs one hash rather than a parse.
///
/// Which key a cache may take is decided by what it stores. One holding a
/// verdict or a count may take the renamed form, those being invariant under
/// a bijection on the atoms. One holding a formula or an automaton may not:
/// reading such a value back would mean renaming atoms inside a tool's own
/// output, and SPOT prints a unary operator hard against its operand
/// (`Ffk1`), so no tokenisation of that output separates the operator from
/// the name. Those caches take `canonical`, which preserves atom names.

/// The rendering of @p ltl's canonical form (see `Formula::canonical`). Atom
/// names are preserved, so a value that names atoms may be stored under this
/// key and handed back to any caller unchanged.
///
/// The reference stays valid for the life of the process: the memo behind it
/// is append-only, and `std::unordered_map` keeps references to its elements
/// valid across a rehash. Returning by value instead would copy the key on

/// left alone, renaming one being how a constant becomes a free variable.
