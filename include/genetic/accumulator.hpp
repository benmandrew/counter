/// the spot, so a `SIGKILL` at any moment leaves every file already written
/// intact -- the same intent as the dashboard's `progress.jsonl`, "one record,
/// flushed as written".
///
/// What lands there is the *raw* set of candidates that passed the output gate,
/// and is deliberately not the run's answer: `repair_N.json` / `repair_N.tlsf`
/// remain the only filtered output, carrying the deduplicated, weakening- and
/// maximality-screened set with its fitness record. A reader that treats the
/// accumulated files as repairs is reading candidates the final filters may
/// well have rejected.
///
/// Nothing touches the filesystem before the first write, so neither the
/// directory nor a file exists until a candidate is accumulated, and a run with
/// `Config::accumulate_repairs` turned off creates neither at all.
