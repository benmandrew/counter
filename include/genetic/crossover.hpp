/// @brief Crossover operators that combine two parent requirements or

#include "genetic/random_source.hpp"
#include "requirement.hpp"

/// Produces an offspring requirement by crossing over every field of the
/// parents but the two flags. Each of the two formula fields is grafted as in
/// AuRUS: with equal probability a subformula of the first parent's field is
/// replaced by one drawn from the second parent's, or the two are joined under
/// a fresh binary operator. Neither branch copies a field verbatim.
///
/// The graft site is drawn uniformly over the field's nodes, so every node is
/// as likely to be rewritten as any other.
///
/// The timing, condition type and scope are each taken from one parent on a
/// coin, a timing that carries a tick count possibly taking the other
/// parent's. The scope keeps its mode, so the two parents must declare the
/// same modes, which crossover_specifications checks before calling this.
///
/// @param first_parent  First parent requirement
/// @param second_parent Second parent requirement
/// @param random_source Random source for branch and selector choices
/// @return              Offspring requirement
