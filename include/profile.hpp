/// @brief Always-compiled, opt-in scope profiler recording wall and per-thread
///        CPU time per named site.
///
/// The existing per-tool counters (LtlfiltStats, RealizabilityChecker, ...)
/// report how long each *external tool* took. They cannot say where that time
/// went inside a call — a fork that copies page tables and an ltlsynt that
/// solves a hard game both land in the same "0.013s avg". This adds the
/// orthogonal axis: named scopes that nest, each recording wall time and the
/// calling thread's CPU time, so a site whose wall greatly exceeds its CPU is
/// identifiably *blocked* rather than *working*.
///
/// Off unless the COUNTER_PROFILE environment variable is set (to a file path
/// for JSON output, or to "1"/"-" for the stderr table only). Disabled, a scope
/// costs one relaxed atomic load.
