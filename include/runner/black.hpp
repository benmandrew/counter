/// Which answer the caller expects, which is what decides whether a query SPOT
/// could not settle is worth escalating to black.
///
/// The two backends fail in opposite directions. black is a bounded model
/// checker, so it finds a model quickly and proves that none exists only by
/// exhausting a completeness bound; SPOT builds an automaton and checks
/// emptiness, at a cost set by the automaton's size rather than by the answer.
/// Escalating an `ExpectSat` query therefore has something to gain -- black is
/// fast on exactly the satisfiable formulae whose automata are large -- while
/// escalating an `ExpectUnsat` one black could only answer by exhausting a
/// bound SPOT already failed to build spends a second subprocess to reach the
/// same non-answer.
///
/// This is a property of the call site rather than of the formula, so it costs
/// nothing to compute: an implication check is `A & !B` and answers UNSAT
/// exactly when the implication holds, while a vacuity or validity screen
/// answers SAT on all but the candidates it exists to catch. Predicting it
/// from the formula instead would mean predicting the verdict, which is the
/// question being asked.
