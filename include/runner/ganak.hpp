/// multiplied back in by the caller, outside this cache. Two guards differing
/// only in operand order, association or atom naming therefore share one
/// exec, which over nine specifications is 20.3% to 49.5% of the execs a run
/// makes.
///
/// What reaches ganak is `formula_key::canonical`'s rendering rather than the
/// caller's spelling, which keeps the variable set: the caller multiplies the
/// count by two per variable of the wider alphabet, so a normalisation that
/// dropped one would undercount the result by that factor. `simplify_ltl` is
/// such a normalisation and is deliberately not used here.
