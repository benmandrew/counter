/// Cost is independent of the verdict, which is what makes this complementary

/// stays flat where black does not: a validity check over an X-chain 640 deep
/// costs 30ms here and does not finish in 60s there. It has its own blowup
/// case in the opposite direction, on satisfiable formulae whose automaton is
/// large -- chained `<->` over `G F` terms, or period-2 counters -- so a
/// caller wanting an answer on those needs black behind it.
///
/// Deliberately not memoised: check_satisfiability caches the decided answer
/// under its own key, so a second cache here would hold the same verdicts
