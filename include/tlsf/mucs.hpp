/// @brief Minimal Unrealizable Core (MUC) extraction for TLSF specifications.
///
/// Given an unrealizable tlsf::Specification, extract_muc() returns the
/// smallest subset of the *system* obligations (the guarantee-side sections
/// PRESET, ASSERT, GUARANTEE) that is still unrealizable when checked against
/// the *full*, unchanged environment side (INITIALLY, REQUIRE, ASSUME). The
/// environment side is held fixed in every realizability query: relaxing an
/// assumption can only make synthesis harder, so it is never part of the core.
///
/// The extractor is QuickXplain (Junker 2004): O(k·log(n/k)) oracle calls for
/// a core of size k out of n guarantee-side formulae. It relies on
/// unrealizability being monotone in the guarantee-side set — adding a system
/// obligation can never restore realizability — which makes a minimal
/// unrealizable subset well defined.
