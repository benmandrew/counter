/// Mutates @p spec by rewriting exactly one section formula. The assumption
/// side (INITIALLY, REQUIRE, ASSUME) is chosen with probability
/// `cfg.tlsf_p_assumption` and the guarantee side (PRESET, ASSERT, GUARANTEE)
/// with the complement. The chosen side falls back to the other when it holds
/// no formulae, then one formula is drawn uniformly across that side's
/// non-empty sections. With probability `cfg.tlsf_p_temporal` the chosen
/// formula is rewritten by the temporal-structure mutation (a recursive
/// re-implementation of Brizzio et al.'s operator, which may insert, drop, or
/// swap X/F/G/U/R/W nodes); otherwise only its propositional subtrees are
/// rewritten and the temporal operator skeleton is preserved. Assumption-side
/// mutations draw atoms from inputs ∪ outputs, as guarantee-side ones do, an
/// initial condition keeping to its own side's signals. If no mutable formula
/// exists the specification is returned unchanged.
///
/// With probability `cfg.p_monotone` the chosen formula takes a monotone
/// rewrite (monotone_rewrite) instead of either of those two, its direction
/// drawn as a fair coin.
///
/// With probability `cfg.p_add_assumption` the operator instead appends a new
/// environment assumption to the ASSUME section (an unconditional
/// `G F <input>` fairness property, or a conditional `G(c -> o <input>)` whose
/// guard may be an output — see tlsf_add_assumption in the .cpp). With
/// probability `cfg.tlsf_p_clone_assumption` that appended assumption is
/// instead a copy of an existing live ASSUME conjunct, which later generations
/// mutate; the template stands in when there is nothing live to copy.
