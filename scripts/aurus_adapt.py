"""Materialise AuRUS h2h output as counter-shaped run directories.

    python3 scripts/aurus_adapt.py --root ~/aurus-h2h-out \\
        --out experiments/results-aurus-curves [--seeds 0-14] [--copy]

`score_curves.py` reads one run directory per (spec, seed): an `accumulated/`
directory of candidate files, an `accumulated/index.tsv` dating each of them,
and `run.json` beside it naming the arm. AuRUS writes none of that. Main.java
dumps `ga.solutions` in list order as spec<i>.tlsf when the run ends, so no
solution file carries a discovery time, and the run.log is the only record
that does -- its per-iteration `#Sol` column is that list's length, so spec_i
was found at the first iteration whose `#Sol` reaches i+1, dated to the
second by the `Elapsed Time` line that follows. score_aurus_anytime.py
established that rule and this imports it rather than restating it.

What comes out is a results directory that score_campaign.py scores with no
flag of its own: run directories named `aurus_<spec>_seed<NN>`, which is what
its seed split, its smallest-first queue and its resume already key on, and
what a `kind = "score"` phase in campaign.toml points its `results` key at.
Both arms of a head-to-head then run through one scorer under one set of
budgets, which is what makes the two sets of curves comparable at all. A
repeat maps to a seed, so `hosts = { av2 = "0-14", av3 = "15-29" }` splits the
30 repeats the way the campaign's own split already reads.

A repeat AuRUS killed at its 7200 s cap wrote no solution files -- they die
with the JVM -- and is skipped by name rather than materialised empty: an
empty run directory scores as a run that found nothing, which is a different
claim from a run whose output was lost. A solution file the iteration series
never reaches is skipped for the same reason, since the alternative is
inventing a discovery time for it. Both are counted in the summary, which is
written to `<out>/aurus-adapt.json` alongside the tree.

The candidate files are symlinked. There are 287,006 of them across the two
lab hosts and the pass runs on the host that holds them; `--copy` makes the
tree self-contained where it has to move instead.
