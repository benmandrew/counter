"""Run the AuRUS baseline campaign and collect metrics to a results CSV.

The head-to-head arm of the ablation campaign (PLAN §3.3): for each spec x
repeat, invoke AuRUS's ./unreal-repair.sh from the AuRUS repo root with the
campaign parameters (BASE_FLAGS plus -GATO=<gato>, and -onlyInputsA for the
nine specs run-all-together.sh drives), one output directory per repeat.
AuRUS is not seedable (its RNG comes from Math.random() with no CLI
override), so independent repeats stand in for seeds and every out.txt is
archived.

`--aurus-root` must point at AuRUS as its authors left it, commit 3f6f01f,
which is the last upstream commit before this project's fork. The fork above
it changes the GA core, the model-counting fitness and the solver layer, and
would measure an optimised AuRUS rather than the published baseline. Only one
substitution is unavoidable: 3f6f01f tracks a macOS Mach-O Strix binary at
lib/new_strix/strix, so any Linux run needs a Linux Strix dropped in there.
Note the entry point lives at the repo root at that commit; the fork later
moved it under scripts/.

Per-run wall time is measured here, externally, rather than trusting the
JVM's self-report (recorded too, as aurus_time_s).

Each run's out.txt is parsed (`Num. of Solutions:`, `Time:`, `Settings{...}`)
into a row of <out-root>/aurus_results.csv. Resumable: a (spec, repeat) whose
out.txt already exists is not re-run — its CSV row is backfilled from the
existing out.txt if missing (wall_time_s blank, since the original wall clock
is gone). Repeat-major ordering, so killing the campaign at a wall-clock
deadline leaves a balanced design across specs.

Concurrency is bounded by a pool of worker threads, each owning one JVM
subprocess (--concurrency, default 10 — ~8 GB heap each via the script's
-Xmx8g stays far under the 125 GB av2/av3 machines). A run that outlives
GATO by 300 s is assumed wedged and its whole process group is killed.

Usage:
    python scripts/aurus_campaign.py --out-root ~/aurus-results \\
        --spot-bin ~/projects/counter/build-release/third_party/spot/bin
    python scripts/aurus_campaign.py --out-root out --specs minepump \\
        --repeats 1 --gato 30                      # smoke test

# The 26 specifications the AuRUS paper evaluates, keyed by the name their
# rows carry in this campaign's CSVs, valued by a path relative to
# <aurus-root>. The tree spans two roots — the case studies and the loose
# `examples/` one — so these are root-relative rather than rooted at
# `case-studies/`, which is what previously made the examples/ rows unnameable.
#
# Eleven of the keys are counter examples/ names, so those rows join directly
# against run_experiments.py's `aurus-h2h` rows; they are H2H_TLSF_SPECS there
# and are the only ones a repair-quality statistic can be computed for. The
# rest run here alone, counter having no family for them yet. Every out.txt is
# archived, so an import later re-scores an existing run rather than needing
# a new one.
#
# The six `-aurus` suffixes are deliberate. counter carries families named
# `detector`, `full-arbiter`, `load-balancer`, `prioritized-arbiter`,
# `round-robin-arbiter` and `simple-arbiter`, taken from SYNTCOMP at different
# parameter instances than these (counter's simple_arbiter_unreal2_3_basic
# against the paper's simple_arbiter_unreal2_2). Reusing the bare names would
# assert a correspondence that does not hold, which is the same reason AuRUS's
# arbiter is `arbiter-aurus` rather than `arbiter`.
#
# Two near-misses to leave alone: full_arbiter/ and syntcomp-unreal/lily02/
# each hold a second unrealizable variant the paper does not use
# (full_arbiter_unreal1_3_2_basic.tlsf, lilydemo01.tlsf), so these are picked
# by filename and never by directory.
#
# lily02 is the syntcomp-unreal copy, not the top-level case-studies/lily02
# one: the paper files Lily02 under SYNTCOMP and that copy carries the five
# references (lilydemo03..07) the row is scored against, where the top-level
# copy is a separate one-reference setup. The two lilydemo02.tlsf files are
# byte-identical, so this fixes provenance rather than behaviour.

# GA parameters common to all 26 runs. These come from the AuRUS authors' own
# drivers under scripts/legacy/, which are the record of how the paper's
# numbers were produced; all three of them agree on every flag here.
#
# `-k=20` is the model-counter bound. The 2026-07-24 campaign ran 10, which
# counted traces to half the depth on AuRUS's side of a comparison where
# counter's own `model_counting.default_bound` is 20; the legacy drivers
# settle it independently of the paper's prose. `-GATO` is supplied per run
# from --gato and is 7200 in all three drivers too. `-geneNUM=0` restates the
# shipped default (GA_GENE_NUM_OF_MUTATIONS), so it is a no-op kept for
# fidelity to the record. See experiments/2026-07-24-ablation/REPORT.md.
#
# `-factors` is STATUS,SYN,SEMANTIC and is a DELIBERATE DEPARTURE from the
# drivers, which do not agree on it: run-all-together.sh omits it,
# run-spectra-icse2019.sh passes `0.7,0.1,0.2`, and
# run-all-sensitivity-syntcomp.sh passes `1,0,0` — status alone, with no
# similarity pressure whatever. Running the last of those would set counter,
# which weights syntactic and semantic similarity, against an AuRUS told to
# ignore both on a third of the corpus, and would flatter counter on repair
# quality for a reason unrelated to search.
#
# All 26 therefore run at `0.7,0.1,0.2`, which departs from the drivers only
# for the SYNTCOMP third: `Settings.setFactors` halves the semantic weight
# into LOST_MODELS and WON_MODELS, so the value is exactly the shipped default
# 0.7/0.1/0.1/0.1 that the other two drivers already run under. It is passed
# explicitly rather than left to the default so the archived settings string
# records the choice.
#
# `-removeGuarantees` appears in none of the drivers and is not passed, so
# AuRUS never deletes a guarantee. counter does, at p_remove_guarantee 0.05.
# That asymmetry in operator sets is a threat to validity, not a bug.

# `-onlyInputsA` restricts generated assumptions to input variables. It is the
