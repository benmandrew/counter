"""Drive experiment campaigns on the lab machines.

    python scripts/campaign.py status            # one table of live state

    python scripts/campaign.py queue
    python scripts/campaign.py tick --host av2
    python scripts/campaign.py cron --print --host av2
    python scripts/campaign.py describe --all --json

A campaign is declared once, in ``experiments/<name>/campaign.toml``: the
branch it runs on, the seed range each host takes, and the phases to run. That
file is the only place a seed split is written down, so the split cannot differ
between the launch, a resume and the merge. ``stage``, ``start`` and ``enqueue``
all read it and none of them accepts a seed range as an argument.

``status`` is read-only. It asks each host for its launch manifests
(``experiments/<stem>-manifest-<host>.json``, written by run_experiments.py),
its git state, its process table and the mtimes underneath each campaign's
result directory, then asks ``run_experiments.py --dry-run`` on that same host
how many rows the launch's selection plans. Nothing here re-derives a sweep:
the manifest says what the launch asked for and the runner says how many rows
that expands to, so a profile edit cannot make this script disagree with the
runner about the size of a campaign.

``collect`` wraps merge_experiments.py rather than reimplementing it -- the
rsync, the natural key and the merge all come from that module -- and adds the
verification the manual step never had: row counts per host against the merged
total, and a duplicate-key scan.

``stage`` prepares a host and refuses by default: a dirty checkout, a live
run, or a branch other than the campaign's each block it, because the recovery
from a wrong ``git checkout -f`` there is somebody's unpushed work.

``enqueue`` and ``tick`` are the unattended path. A queue entry lives on the
host that will run it, under ``experiments/queue/NNN-<name>.toml``, and a cron
tick takes the lowest-numbered queued entry and runs its next phase under a
lock. Nothing polls: the tick is the only thing that watches a run.

A queue holds campaigns on different branches, so a tick stages the checkout
onto the branch and commit its entry froze at enqueue, then rebuilds. It does
that for the branch alone. A dirty checkout and a live run still stop it dead,
because those are the two things a reset destroys and nothing here can bring
back; ``stage --force`` remains the only way past either, and it wants a human
at a terminal.

``describe`` is the archive's half of the same idea, for the campaigns that
closed before any of this existed. It derives a declaration from what the
archive already carries -- the merged results CSV, the per-host CSVs and
PROVENANCE.json -- and prints it. It writes nothing: the derivation's sources
sit in the directory it read, and a campaign is reproduced from its vendored
``scripts/`` at a commit where this file does not exist.

Hosts are reached by their ssh-config alias (``av2``), not by the FQDN in
merge_experiments.REMOTES: the FQDN form falls through to password auth under
BatchMode, which a status poll cannot answer.
