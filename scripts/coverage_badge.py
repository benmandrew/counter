"""Measure line coverage of `src/` and `include/` and draw the badge the README embeds.

    python scripts/coverage_badge.py           # build, run the suite, write the badge
    python scripts/coverage_badge.py --check   # fail if the committed badge is stale
    python scripts/coverage_badge.py --json r.json   # reuse an llvm-cov export

The badge is a file in the repository rather than a call out to a badge service, so
the README renders the same on a fork with no secrets and in an offline clone. That
only works if the file is regenerated when the number moves, which is what `--check`
is for.

Measurement is clang's source-based coverage: the `coverage` preset compiles with
`-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping`, its test preset points
`LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` at `build-coverage/profraw/`, and `llvm-cov export` reads the
merged profile back against every instrumented binary. GCC cannot build that preset
-- the flags are clang's, and `--coverage` with gcov would be a different number
from a different tool.
