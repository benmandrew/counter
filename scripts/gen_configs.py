"""Generate TOML config files for all experiment sweeps.

Writes one file per (selection scheme, sweep, level) to
experiments/configs/<scheme>/. Safe to re-run — existing files are overwritten.

The scheme lives in the directory rather than the filename because
run_experiments.py parses (sweep, level) out of the filename, and it reads the
scheme back off the parent directory. Every sweep is generated once per scheme,
which makes selection_scheme a factor of the design rather than a constant.

Usage:
    python scripts/gen_configs.py                       # the standard grid
    python scripts/gen_configs.py --schemes nsga2-truncate   # one scheme only
    python scripts/gen_configs.py --sweeps C D E        # specific sweeps
    python scripts/gen_configs.py --sweeps C --levels default,status-only
                                                        # specific levels only
    python scripts/gen_configs.py --generations 40 --population-size 1000 \\
        --out-dir experiments/configs-cj-large          # a larger operating point
    python scripts/gen_configs.py --weakening both      # cross run_weakening in
    python scripts/gen_configs.py --metric both         # cross direct/log metric in

# Selection schemes the whole grid is duplicated across. Every generated config
# pins the scheme explicitly rather than relying on the config.hpp default,
# which is "nsga2-apportion" and so is *not* the head of this list.
# nsga2-apportion is appended rather than ordered next to nsga2-truncate so the
# first two entries keep the positions the earlier grids were generated under.
#
# The two NSGA-II schemes were renamed: "nsga2" -> "nsga2-truncate" and
# "nsga2-replicate" -> "nsga2-apportion". That is a hard break rather than a
# deprecation -- config_io.cpp rejects the old spellings, so a config emitted
# under them does not run at all. Each string here is also a config *directory*
# name: scheme_of() in run_experiments.py reads it back into the `selection`
# column of every results CSV, and that column joins KEY_FIELDS in
# merge_experiments.py -- the natural key for resume and merge. Roughly a
# quarter of a million archived rows were written under the old names, so the
# rename would make every one of them miss its key and re-run a finished
# campaign. SCHEME_ALIASES / canonical_scheme() in run_experiments.py and
# merge_experiments.py close that gap by canonicalising every `selection` value
# read back; nothing else here may depend on the old spellings.

# run_weakening as a crossed factor: each (scheme, sweep, level) is emitted once

# lives in the directory for the same reason the scheme does — level_value_of()
# in run_experiments.py parses a trailing number off level_name, so folding it
# into the filename would corrupt the level value.
#
# --weakening defaults to None rather than a state, because passing it is what
# introduces the extra directory level. Without it the layout stays flat
# (<scheme>/sweep_X_level.toml) and run_weakening comes from DEFAULTS or the
# level's own override, which is what keeps the no-arg output byte-identical to
# the grids generated before this factor existed.

# string config_io.cpp's apply_model_counting accepts, or the run aborts. Like

# "mono"/"muc", and here the TOML value happens to differ only for "mono"
# ("monolithic"), the string config_io.cpp's apply_tlsf accepts. Like

# Mirrors the built-in defaults from include/config.hpp. Every entry tracks the
# binary except the nine enumerated below, and check_config_schema.py enforces
# that: it walks this table against config.hpp's in-class initialisers and fails
# on any key that is neither mapped to a member nor listed there as exempt. A
# key whose C++ default moves is therefore corrected here rather than noticed
# later — which matters most for the VINTAGE_KEYS, since --pin-vintage writes
# *these* values into the generated configs.
#
# The deliberate divergences, and why each one does not follow the binary:
#
#   * run_weakening — pinned True; the binary has defaulted it False since
#     2026-08-20. It is a crossed factor (wkon/wkoff) whose flat, non-crossed
#     configs are attributed to LEGACY_WEAKENING ("wkon") by run_experiments.py,
#     and `weakening` is one of merge_experiments.KEY_FIELDS, so the emitted
#     value has to keep matching that recorded CSV column or ~225k archived rows
#     stop joining their own key.
#   * metric — pinned "direct"; config.hpp defaults it to "logarithmic". Same
#     argument: a flat config carries no metric directory, so metric_of()
#     attributes it to LEGACY_METRIC ("direct"), and `metric` is a CSV key
#     column. Cross the metric explicitly with --metric to exercise
#     "logarithmic".
#   * selection_scheme — pinned "nsga2-truncate"; config.hpp defaults it to
#     "nsga2-apportion". Same argument again: the scheme is the config
#     *directory* name that scheme_of() reads back into the `selection` CSV key
#     column, and every generated config pins it explicitly, so the first entry
#     of SCHEMES has to stay the one past grids were generated under.
#   * weight_syntactic / weight_semantic / weight_status — pinned 0.33 each;
#     config.hpp reads 0.2 / 0.5 / 0.5. These three are emitted
#     *unconditionally* into every config, so every archived config states them
#     and is self-describing about them. Following the binary would change the
#     emitted values and break comparability with every past grid, and would buy
#     nothing, since no archived config was ever silent about them.
#   * ltlsynt_timeout_ms / ltl2tgba_timeout_ms / max_scoring_failure_rate — 0
#     and 0.0 are "do not emit" sentinels read by make_toml, not mirrors of
#     config.hpp's 10000 ms, 60000 ms and 0.15. A campaign that needs a cap sets
#     one; everything else inherits the binary's.
#   * dashboard — False is the same kind of sentinel (emitted only when true).
#     It coincides with config.hpp today, and must stay False if that moves.
