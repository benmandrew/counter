"""Score a campaign's maximality curves on one host, over that host's seeds.

    python3 scripts/score_campaign.py --results experiments/results-rematch \\
        --out experiments/curves-rematch --seeds 0 1 2 3 [--workers 8] \\
        [--cores 4] [--cuts 20] [--maximal-timeout 900] \\
        [--compare-timeout 600] [--deadline-s 4500] [--wall-cap-s 5400] \\
        [--allow-stale-binary] [--dry-run]

The scoring twin of run_experiments.py, and what a `kind = "score"` phase in
campaign.toml runs. The search writes one run directory per (spec, seed) under
a results directory; this walks those directories and runs score_curves.py
--maximality over each, one invocation per run, writing <out>/<run>.csv.

Two campaigns (2026-08-29-aurus-matched and 2026-09-04-aurus-rematch) needed
this pass, at 716 and roughly 325 worker-hours, and both times it was a pair
of hand-rolled bash scripts on the hosts, a budget file edited over ssh, and
provenance assembled by hand afterwards. This file reproduces those scripts'
mechanics -- a smallest-first queue by accumulated/index.tsv line count, N
workers each pinned to a block of cores, one score_curves.py per run under an
outer wall cap, the per-run CSV moved into place through a .part file, a
timings line per run naming the budgets it ran under, a failures list -- and
adds what they lacked: a manifest recording every budget and both scoring
binaries' commits, the same freshness gate run_experiments.py runs, and a
resume, so a requeued phase re-scores only what failed.

A host scores only the seeds it is given. The seed split is enforced here, in
the same place the runner enforces it, so two hosts sharing a results
directory layout never score one run twice.

Stdlib only, on python 3.10: this runs on the lab hosts from a cron tick.
