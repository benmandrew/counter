"""Tests for aurus_adapt.py, the AuRUS-to-counter run-directory adapter.

No pytest dependency, matching test_experiment_paths.py: run it directly
(``python3 scripts/test_aurus_adapt.py``) and it exits non-zero on the first
failure.

The failure modes worth guarding are the silent ones, and all three are silent
in the same way -- the pass runs, writes curves, and the curves are wrong.

A misdated candidate moves a point on the only axis these curves are read on,
and nothing downstream can tell an arrival time apart from a fabricated one,
so the dating rule is checked against a run.log fixture of AuRUS's own shape
rather than against the adapter's idea of it. A run directory whose name does
not carry `_<spec>_seed<NN>` is skipped by score_campaign.queue_runs without a
word, since a directory with no seed suffix is how that queue recognises
something that is not a run -- so the name is checked through the two readers
that parse it rather than by eye. And a rewritten run directory that keeps a
previous adaptation's candidate files scores those files too: `maximal` and
`compare` are both given the whole directory, where the index names only what
this pass wrote.
