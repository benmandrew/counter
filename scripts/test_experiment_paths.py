"""Round-trip tests for the factor-directory parsing in run_experiments.py.

No pytest dependency: run it directly (``python scripts/test_experiment_paths.py``)
and it exits non-zero on the first failure. The one thing worth guarding is that
``scheme_of`` / ``weakening_of`` / ``metric_of`` recover the right factor from a
path regardless of how deep the factors nest — a config that lands one level
deeper than a parser expects is silently mis-attributed to the wrong cell and
its rows key wrong (the trap REPORT.md flags).

The second half guards the commit-provenance columns, whose failure mode is the
mirror image: a column that joins the resume or merge key makes every archived
row miss and re-runs campaigns that are already finished.
