/// One definition of the sampling, because two fingerprints are only a test
/// of implication against each other when they were drawn from the same
/// words. The pairwise sweeps in filter.cpp on both paths and the equivalence
/// quotient in maximal.cpp all prefilter, and their fingerprints have to
/// agree.

/// `run_bounded_async` launch-order argument again — a change that moves cost
/// and no output has one code path.
///
/// 256 words at a lasso of at most five positions refuted 95.9% of the ordered
/// pairs of a 421-candidate round-robin-arbiter-aurus set, leaving 4.07% for

/// and paid once per specification, against a quadratic number of pairs.
